          <p class="dog-description">
            The Cane Corso is a majestic Italian mastiff known for its imposing
            stature, powerful musculature, and deep loyalty. Originally bred for
            guarding property and hunting big game, it serves as a fearless
            protector that is deeply devoted to its family. Despite its tough
            exterior, it is highly intelligent and tends to be calm and
            affectionate with its inner circle. However, due to its size and
            dominant nature, it requires early socialization and confident
            leadership. It is an ideal companion for experienced owners who can
            provide consistent training and regular physical exercise.

          <h3 class="dog-name">French Bulldog:</h3>
          <p class="dog-description">
            The French Bulldog is a small, sturdy dog breed known for its
            bat-like ears, compact body, and friendly personality. Originally
            bred in France, it became a popular companion dog due to its
            affectionate nature and adaptability. Despite its small size, it is
            quite sturdy and has a strong personality. It is known for being
            playful, intelligent, and highly social, making it an excellent
            family pet. However, due to its brachycephalic (short-nosed)
            structure, it can be prone to breathing difficulties and requires
            careful attention to temperature control.

          <h3 class="dog-name">Siberian Husky:</h3>
          <p class="dog-description">
            The Siberian Husky is a stunning medium-sized working dog, famous
            for its wolf-like appearance, thick double coat, and striking blue
            or multicolored eyes. Originally bred by the Chukchi people for
            pulling sleds over long distances, they possess incredible
            endurance, speed, and a high-energy "work ethic." They are highly
            intelligent but notoriously independent and stubborn. Because of
            their history, they need significant daily exercise and a secure
            yard to prevent them from following their strong instinct to run and
            explore.

          <h3 class="dog-name">Boxer:</h3>
          <p class="dog-description">
            The Boxer is a sleek, muscular dog from Germany, famously known as
            the "Peter Pan" of the canine world due to its playful, high-energy
            personality that lasts well into adulthood. Originally bred for
            hunting and guarding, they are incredibly loyal protectors who form
            deep bonds with their human families. While they can be headstrong
            and require consistent training, their intelligence and goofy sense
            of humor make them wonderful companions. Because they are so
            athletic, they need plenty of daily exercise and mental stimulation
            to stay happy and out of trouble.

          <h3 class="dog-name">Dachshund:</h3>
          <p class="dog-description">
            The Dachshund, affectionately known as the "wiener dog," is a small
            hound from Germany originally bred to scent, chase, and flush out
            badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals. They are famous for their
            unique silhouette: a long, low-slung body with short, sturdy legs
            and a deep chest that provides ample lung capacity for underground
            work. They come in two sizes (Standard and Miniature) and three coat
            types: smooth, long-haired, and wire-haired. Despite their size,
            Dachshunds are incredibly brave, independent, and sometimes
            stubborn, possessing a loud bark that rivals much larger dogs.

          <h3 class="dog-name">Labrador Retriever:</h3>
          <p class="dog-description">
            The Labrador is friendly, outgoing nature and exceptional
            versatility. Originally from Newfoundland, they were bred as "water
            dogs" to help fishermen retrieve nets and escaped fish, which
            explains their water-resistant double coat and unique "otter tail"
            used for swimming. They are highly intelligent and eager to please,
            making them top choices for service work, search and rescue, and
            family companionship. Labs are famously food-motivated and
            high-energy, requiring plenty of daily exercise, their gentle
            temperament and patience make them legendary family dogs.
