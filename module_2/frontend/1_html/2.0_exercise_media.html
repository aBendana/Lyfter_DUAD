              Grizzly bears are large, powerful mammals known for their
              distinctive hump of muscle on their shoulders and thick brown fur.
              They are highly adaptable and can be found in forests, mountains,
              and river valleys. Grizzlies are omnivores, feeding on plants,
              insects, fish, and small mammals. Despite their size, they can run
              fast and are excellent diggers and swimmers.

              The Barbary lion, once native to North Africa, is known for its
              impressive size and dark, full mane that extended over the
              shoulders and belly. These lions were powerful predators that
              lived in forests and mountainous regions. Although now extinct in
              the wild (still in zoos), they are remembered as one of the
              largest lion subspecies ever recorded.

              The great white shark is a powerful marine predator known for its
              size, torpedo-shaped body, and rows of sharp, replaceable teeth.
              It inhabits coastal and offshore waters around the world,
              particularly in cool temperate regions. Great whites are fast
              swimmers and rely on their acute senses to locate prey over long
              distances.
