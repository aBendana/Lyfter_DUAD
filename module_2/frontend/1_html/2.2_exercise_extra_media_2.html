              Mars is a rocky planet known for its reddish color caused by iron
              oxide on its surface. It has mountains, vast canyons, and polar
              ice caps that change with the seasons. Evidence suggests that
              liquid water once flowed across its terrain, leaving behind dried
              riverbeds and mineral deposits. Often called the "Red Planet,"
              Mars remains one of the most studied worlds due to its potential
              for past life and its importance in future human exploration.

              Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, composed mainly
              of hydrogen and helium. Its atmosphere displays vibrant cloud
              bands, swirling storms, and the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that
              has raged for centuries. Beneath its thick atmosphere lies an
              immense, high-pressure interior that may contain a deep liquid
              metallic hydrogen layer. Jupiter's powerful gravity shapes the
              orbits of nearby objects and protects the inner planets by
              capturing or deflecting comets and asteroids.

              Saturn is a gas giant famous for its bright and extensive ring
              system made of ice, rock, and dust particles that orbit the
              planet. Like Jupiter, it is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium
              and features powerful winds, swirling cloud patterns, and intense
              storms in its atmosphere. Saturn is home to a large collection of
              moons, including Titan, one of the most Earth-like bodies in the
              solar system with thick clouds and liquid methane lakes. Its
              striking appearance and complex system make Saturn one of the most
              fascinating planets to study.
